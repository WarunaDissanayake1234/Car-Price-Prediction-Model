# Car Price Prediction Model with Lasso Regression

This repository contains code for a machine learning model that predicts car prices using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, with the Lasso model identified as the best performer.

## Overview

This project implements machine learning models using Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to predict car prices. Python programming language was used for implementation, and Google Colab served as the development environment. The evaluation results indicated that the Lasso Regression model outperformed the Linear Regression model for this task.

## Requirements

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab (for running the code)
- Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WarunaDissanayake1234/Car-Price-Prediction-Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```

3. **Run the Code:**
   - Open the Jupyter Notebook or upload the provided notebook to Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess the data, implement Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, compare their performance, and utilize the Lasso model for car price prediction.
